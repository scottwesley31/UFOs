# UFOs
Module 11

## Overview of Project
Dana, a data journalist from Oregon who is interested in UFOs, has a JavaScript file full of UFO sighting data (date, location, sighting duration, sighting description, etc.) She has a goal for visualizing this data on a webpage which displays all of the UFO data in a table with a user-filtering functionality. Using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS she put together a website that can filter the data for date only.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to pick up where Dana left off and to further develop the search/filter functionality of the webpage to include filtering by city, state, country, and shape in addition to date. Following refactoring of JavaScript and HTML files, the webpage allows for users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results
### How to perform search

## Summary
### One drawback of webpage
### Two additional recommendations for further development
